## 📊 Evidence Log (Public & Verifiable)

As part of my professional development and UK Global Talent Visa (Tech Nation) preparation, I maintain a **public Evidence Log** documenting all publishable work, projects, articles, diagrams, videos, and technical contributions.

This log provides:

- Transparent, timestamped proof of my activities  
- Verifiable links to GitHub, Medium, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Portfolio PDFs  
- A centralised record of academic and professional outputs  
- A growing track record of MIS, data architecture, and EdTech work  

👉 **Live Evidence Log (Google Sheets):**  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yiPxl3hW3pNhoLIQPdHDV8dA1bzDB1Otm70789YkBy4/edit?usp=sharing

The Evidence Log is updated continuously as I convert coursework, consulting work, and STEM teaching activities into publicly accessible deliverables.  
It supports my journey as an aspiring digital technology leader and MIS/EdTech consultant.
